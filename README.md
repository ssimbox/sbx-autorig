# ssimbox-rigTools
Welcome to my repo, first in my life.

Here I'm going to upload scripts I develop in my free time. I'm a character rigger and I found very useful write my own scripts. 

Actually I developed two simple scripts
* IKFK-Builder - Tool useful in building linear IKFK chain. I use it when I need to rig legs and arms
* Autohand - Hand maker. Make constraints, controller and attributes on it. Save a lot of tedious work
* Game Hierarchy Maker - I found necessary use a hiearchy to export in Unity so this tool helps you in make new joints and constraint rapidly 

Actually there is a simple rule to remember using my tools **naming convention**. 
I use this type of joint naming: *side_jointName* ---> *l_upperleg* or *r_knee*. Suffixes are ok but I need this kind of prefix.

This is just a start, I want to build always better tools to help my own works and, hopefully, speed up yours.
